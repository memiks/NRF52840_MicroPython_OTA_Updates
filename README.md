# NRF52840_MicroPython_OTA_Updates
Update your micropython code "over the air" using Nordic's nRF52 proprietary radio

This is a first-pass first attempt at doing OTA updates using micropython.  So, feel free to use it as inspiration.

You can read more about it here:

As a first pass, I'm happy with it.  However, I'm making no represetations or warranties.  If  you want to use it, do so solely at your own risk and make sure you test it adequately for whatever your purposes may be.
